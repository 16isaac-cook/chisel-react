# Chisel

Chisel ~is~ _will eventually be_ a tool for creating and managing many things for tabletop roleplaying games. The main focus is currently Pathfinder 2nd edition and D&D 5th edition, but more may be created in the future.

The project is currently _very_ bare bones, with some basic React components ready to go. I'm currently working on the section of the tool I've dubbed _Quill_ which is used by GMs to help write campaign settings.

This is being made as a passion project with no current plans to monetize the content. It's just for fun!

## Planned Features

-   General Features
    -   LAN Connection for GMs to access and interact with their players' sheets
    -   Homebrew Creation Tool
-   Features for Players
    -   Character Creation
    -   Automatically Updating Character Sheets
    -   Access to Campaign files granted by the GM
-   Features for GMs
    -   World building tools for easily outlining a setting
    -   Homebrew creating and sharing for players

## How To Use

The project runs on the `electron` package with some extra packages added on for convenience. After cloning the repo you'll need to run `npm install` to get the required packages, then run `npm start` to launch the program using electron.
